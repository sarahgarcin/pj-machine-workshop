## Keyboard events
The PJ Machine has some functions include by default you can use. 
All functions can be fired by a keypress. 

- O > Go to previous content
- P > Go to next content
- A > Move Left
- Q > Move Right 
- W > Move Down
- S > Move Up
- U > Zoom In 
- Space Bar > Zoom Out
- I > Decrease block width
- E > Increase block width
- Y > Increase letter spacing
- R > Decrease letter spacing
- N > Change font (random in an array of fonts)
- B > Change color (random)
- M > Rotate Clockwise
- L > Rotate Counterclockwise
- T > Generate PDF

## Connecting to the same PJ Machine with another device (Multiplayer Mode)
- Connect the devices on the same wifi 
- Run the app on a computer (after installing all dependencies)
    - Open the terminal and run ```node server.js```
    - Get the IP address of the computer (go to network settings to find it)
    - Go to http://IPaddress:1337 (replace IPaddress by server IP address you find before) on another device (could be smartphone, tablet, another computer) 


## How to add content 
- Go to PJ Machine folder 
- Open ```content/data/blocks``` folder
- Here you have all the content folders
- One folder = a block on the PJ Machine interface
- Copy paste the ```example-folder``` (find it in the project root) in ```content/data/blocks`` 
- Rename the folder with the next number 
- Open data.txt — data.txt are files where block data are stored
- Change the path replacing example-folder by the name of your folder
- Change the index: By the position of your folder. If your folder is the sixth folder change index to 6. All folders should have an unique index.
- Change the content.
- Reload the server:
Go to the terminal and stop the server: ```ctrl + C``` and then ```node server.js```

The content should be written in markdown. 

### Markdown memo

```# Big Title (h1)```  
```## Sub Title (h2)```  
```### Sub Sub Title (h3)```  
```#### Sub Sub Sub Title (h4)```  
```#### Sub Sub Sub Sub Title (h5)```  
```**Bold**```  
```*Italic*```  

#### Add an image
- Add your image in the folder   
```![alt](data/blocks/nameoftheblockfolder/nameofimage.jpg)```
- Or add an image from the web
```![alt](http://website.com/image.jpg)``` 

## Page settings
You can easily change the page settings: size, scale and margins
- Open ```content/page.json```
- Change the data here
- Run ```gulp``` in the terminal
- Reload the server and reload you page in browser

## App settings
- Open ```content/settings.js```
- Change the data (documentation in the file) 
In this file you can change the name of your project and settings for some functions as zoom, move and rotate. 
- Restart the server and reload you page in browser


## Arduino and Nodejs
To work with Arduino and Nodejs, we use the Johnny-Five node module.
You can find the documentation and examples here: http://johnny-five.io/examples/

An example is setting up in the PJ Machine. You can plug a joystick and move blocks with it. 

### Joystick and Jonnhy-Five 
- Plug Joystick to Arduino, like this
    - Ground - wired to the ground rail
    - +5V - wired to the power rail
    - VRx - the “X” value of the joystick, wired to Analog In 0
    - VRy - the “Y” value of the joystick, wired to Analog In 1
- Documentation for joystick and node is here: http://johnny-five.io/examples/joystick/
- Code for joystick is in the main.js file line 71
- Run ```node server.js``` in the terminal 
- If you have an error, follow these instructions: 
https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started#trouble-shooting

### Adding Arduino code
- Open main.js file
- Write your code below the Arduino joystick function call line 41
Functions are presetted in the program.   
Write your code in the server-side and send the data to the client-side.

Syntax to broadcast data in real time from server side to client side: ```io.sockets.emit(“nameOfEvent”, data);```

The list of functions and how to use it:

#### Change block 
Changing the selected block to act on.   
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoChangeBlock", direction);```  
Where direction should be “next” or “prev”

#### Move the block
Moving the block up, down, left and right  
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoMove", direction);```  
Where direction should be “up”, “down”, “left” or “right”

#### Zoom In / Zoom Out in block
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoZoomBlock", direction);```  
Where zoom should be “zoomin” or “zoomout”

#### Change the size of a block
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoChangeBlockSize", direction);```  
Where direction should be “decreaseSize” or “increaseSize”

#### Change letter spacing
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoChangeWordSpacing", direction);```  
Where direction should be “decreaseSpacing” or “increaseSpacing”

#### Change the font
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoChangeFont", direction);```  
Where font is the name of the font.  
List of fonts available in the PJ Machine  
"aileron", "fira", "inknut", "nanook", "reglo", "roboto", "terminal", "vollkorn"

#### Change the font color
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoChangeColor", direction);```  
Where color is the color you want for your font (color can be in hex or rgb)

#### Rotate the block
```io.sockets.emit("arduinoRotateBlock", direction);```  
Where direction should be “clockwise” or “counterclockwise”

- When you want to test your code, restart the server and reload you page in browser

## Adding new features

### Sending events to server 
At this time PJ Machine is working with keypress.   
The programm is calling a function relative to specific keys.   
If you want to change the kind of interaction in javascript, you could get the data from where you want and send them to the server.   
Write your code in the ```public/js/pj-send-events.js``` file (jquery is installed)

Functions are pre-defined, and can be used easily.

The list of functions: 

#### Change block 
Changing the selected block to act on.   
```sendEvent('changeBlock', direction);```  
Where direction should be “next” or “prev”

#### Move the block 
Moving the block up, down, left and right  
```sendEvent('moveBlock', direction);```  
Where direction should be “up”, “down”, “left” or “right”

#### Zoom In / Zoom Out in block
```sendEvent('zoomBlock', zoom);```  
Where zoom should be “zoomin” or “zoomout”

#### Change the size of a block
```sendEvent('changeBlockSize', direction);```  
Where direction should be “decreaseSize” or “increaseSize”

#### Change letter spacing
```sendEvent('changeWordSpacing', direction);```  
Where direction should be “decreaseSpacing” or “increaseSpacing”

#### Change the font
```sendEvent('changeFont', font);```  
Where font is the name of the font.  
List of fonts available in the PJ Machine  
"aileron", "fira", "inknut", "nanook", "reglo", "roboto", "terminal", "vollkorn"

#### Change the font color
```sendEvent('changeColor', color);```  
Where color is the color you want for your font (color can be in hex or rgb)

#### Rotate the block
```sendEvent('rotateBlock', direction);```  
Where direction should be “clockwise” or “counterclockwise”

## Adding / Changing style (css or sass)

### CSS 
Add your own css in ```public/css/public.css```

### SASS
If you feel sassy, you can add your style with sass in ```public/sass/style.scss```  
Then run ```gulp``` in the terminal (you need to have gulp install)

## Adding / Changing html (jade)
The program is using a html template named jade.  
Changing jade in ```views/index.jade```  
Jade documentation: https://naltatis.github.io/jade-syntax-docs/  
Html to Jade Converter: http://html2jade.org/
